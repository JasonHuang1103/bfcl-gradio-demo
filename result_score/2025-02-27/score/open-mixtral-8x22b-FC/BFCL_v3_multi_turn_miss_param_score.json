Data Preprocessing\n2. Model Training\n3. Model Evaluation\n4. Model Deployment\n\nData Preprocessing\n------------------\n\nThe dataset is preprocessed using the following steps:\n\n1. Load the dataset using the pandas library.\n2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.\n3. Scale the features using the StandardScaler from sklearn.\n\nModel Training\n--------------\n\nThe model is trained using the following steps:\n\n1. Import the LinearRegression model from sklearn.\n2. Fit the model on the training data.\n3. Save the model using the joblib library.\n\nModel Evaluation\n----------------\n\nThe model is evaluated using the following steps:\n\n1. Load the saved model using the joblib library.\n2. Evaluate the model on the testing data using the mean_squared_error and r2_score functions from sklearn.\n3. Plot the predicted values against the actual values using matplotlib.\n\nModel Deployment\n----------------\n\nThe model is deployed using the following steps:\n\n1. Create a Flask web application.\n2. Load the saved model using the joblib library.\n3. Create a route to accept input data and return the predicted output.\n4. Test the application using a web browser.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn this project, we have analyzed the performance of a simple linear regression model on a synthetic dataset.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, use the `cd` function to change the current working directory to the parent directory of the 'Drafts' directory.\n2. Then, use the `ls` function to list all the files and directories in the 'Drafts' directory.\n3. Next, use the `rm` function to delete each file in the 'Drafts' directory.\n4. Finally, use the `rmdir` function to delete the 'Drafts' directory itself.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:\n```python\n# Change the current working directory to the parent directory of 'Drafts'\ncd(\"..\")\n\n# List all the files and directories in the 'Drafts' directory\nfiles = ls(\"Drafts\")\n\n# Delete each file in the 'Drafts' directory\nfor file in files:\n    if file != \".\" and file != \"..\":\n        rm(\"Drafts/\" + file)\n\n# Delete the 'Drafts' directory itself\nrmdir(\"Drafts\")\n```\nThis code assumes that you are currently in the 'Drafts' directory. If you are not, you will need to navigate to the parent directory using the `cd` function before running this code.\n\nAlso, be careful when using the `rm` and `rmdir` functions, as they will permanently delete files and directories. Make sure you have a backup of any important data before running this code."}, {"role": "handler_log", "content": "Error decoding the model response.
