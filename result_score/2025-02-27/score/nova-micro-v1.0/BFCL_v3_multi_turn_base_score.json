If Rivermist is a real place, you might want to use a mapping service like Google Maps, Apple Maps, or another GPS tool to get the precise distance.\n\nFor a general idea, here\u2019s how you can find the distance using Google Maps:\n\n1. Open Google Maps on your computer or mobile device.\n2. In the search bar, type \"San Francisco, CA, USA\" and ensure it\u2019s selected as the starting point.\n3. In the destination field, type \"Rivermist\" (or the correct name if it\u2019s a real place).\n4. Press Enter or click on the search icon.\n5. The map will display the route, and the distance will be shown at the top of the page in miles or kilometers, depending on your settings.\n\nOnce you have the distance, you can then calculate the fuel consumption and travel time based on the mode of transportation you plan to use (e.g., driving, flying, etc.). For driving, you might also want to consider factors like traffic, road conditions, and the type of vehicle you\u2019re using to get a more accurate estimate."], ["To post your exciting trip announcement on Twitter, you can use the following format:\n\n```plaintext\nExcited for my trip from San Francisco to Rivermist! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude97 #JourneyAhead @TravelBuddy\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to posting it:\n\n1. **Log in to Twitter**: Open your Twitter app or go to the Twitter website and log in to your account.\n\n2. **Compose a Tweet**:\n   - Click on the tweet composition box (it looks like a feather icon) at the top of your Twitter feed.\n   - Type in the content: \"Excited for my trip from San Francisco to Rivermist! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude97 #JourneyAhead @TravelBuddy\"\n\n3. **Add Media (Optional)**: If you want to add an image or GIF to make your tweet more engaging, you can do so by clicking on the photo icon in the tweet composition box.\n\n4. **Review and Post**: Double-check your tweet to make sure everything looks good.

If Rivermist is a real place, you might want to use a mapping service like Google Maps, Apple Maps, or another GPS tool to get the precise distance.\n\nFor a general idea, here\u2019s how you can find the distance using Google Maps:\n\n1. Open Google Maps on your computer or mobile device.\n2. In the search bar, type \"San Francisco, CA, USA\" and ensure it\u2019s selected as the starting point.\n3. In the destination field, type \"Rivermist\" (or the correct name if it\u2019s a real place).\n4. Press Enter or click on the search icon.\n5. The map will display the route, and the distance will be shown at the top of the page in miles or kilometers, depending on your settings.\n\nOnce you have the distance, you can then calculate the fuel consumption and travel time based on the mode of transportation you plan to use (e.g., driving, flying, etc.). For driving, you might also want to consider factors like traffic, road conditions, and the type of vehicle you\u2019re using to get a more accurate estimate."}, {"role": "handler_log", "content": "Successfully decoded model response.", "model_response_decoded": []}, {"role": "handler_log", "content": "Empty response from the model.
