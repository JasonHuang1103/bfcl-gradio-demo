Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```\n   git clone git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git\n   cd nodejs-welcome\n   ```\n\n2. Analyze the contents of the repo and create the following:\n\n   2.1 Create/update Dockerfile:\n   Based on the analysis, you can create a Dockerfile in the root directory of the repository. Here's an example of a Dockerfile for a Node.js application:\n   ```\n   FROM node:14\n   WORKDIR /app\n   COPY package*.json ./\n   RUN npm install\n   COPY . .\n   EXPOSE 8080\n   CMD [ \"npm\", \"start\" ]\n   ```\n\n   2.2 Create Kubernetes YAML files:\n   You can create two YAML files: one for the deployment and one for the service. Here's an example:\n   - deployment.yaml\n     ```\n     apiVersion: apps/v1\n     kind: Deployment\n     metadata:\n       name: nodejs-deployment\n     spec:\n       replicas: 3\n       selector:\n         matchLabels:\n           app: nodejs-app\n       template:\n         metadata:\n           labels:\n             app: nodejs-app\n         spec:\n           containers:\n           - name: nodejs-container\n             image: your-docker-hub-username/nodejs-welcome:latest\n             ports:\n             - containerPort: 8080\n     ```\n   - service.yaml\n     ```\n     apiVersion: v1\n     kind: Service\n     metadata:\n       name: nodejs-service\n     spec:\n       selector:\n         app: nodejs-app\n       ports:\n         - protocol: TCP\n           port: 80\n           targetPort: 8080\n       type: LoadBalancer\n     ```\n\n   2.3 Create a GitHub Actions file:\n   You can create a GitHub Actions workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Here's an example that builds and pushes your Docker image to Docker Hub whenever you push to the main branch:\n   ```\n   name: Build and Push Docker Image\n\n   on:\n     push:\n       branches:\n         - main\n\n   jobs:\n     build-and-push:\n       runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n       steps:\n         - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n         - name: Set up Docker Buildx\n           uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1\n         - name: Login to Docker Hub\n           uses: docker/login-action@v1\n           with:\n             username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}\n             password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}\n         - name: Build and push\n           id: build-and-push\n           uses: docker/build-push-action@v2\n           with:\n             context: .\n             push: true\n             tags: your-docker-hub-username/nodejs-welcome:latest\n   ```\n\n3. Add all changed files to git changes:\n   ```\n   git add .\n   ```\n\n4. Commit and push to the repo:\n   ```\n   git commit -m \"Add Dockerfile, Kubernetes YAMLs, and GitHub Actions workflow\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```", "input_token_count": 793, "output_token_count": 853, "latency": 9.405661344528198}

{"id": "live_irrelevance_370-81-31", "result": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of search engines, revolutionizing the way we find information online. AI-powered search engines use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to deliver more accurate, relevant, and personalized search results.\n\nOne of the key applications of AI in search engines is Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP enables search engines to understand the context and intent behind a user's query, rather than just matching keywords. This is achieved through techniques such as semantic analysis, which allows the search engine to understand the meaning of words and how they relate to each other.\n\nAnother important aspect of AI in search engines is machine learning. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze patterns in user behavior and search data, allowing the search engine to continuously improve its results. For example, if a user frequently clicks on a particular type of result, the search engine may learn to prioritize similar results in the future.\n\nAI also plays a crucial role in voice search, which has become increasingly popular with the rise of smart speakers and virtual assistants. Voice search requires advanced speech recognition and NLP capabilities to accurately transcribe and interpret spoken queries.\n\nMoreover, AI helps in providing personalized search results. By analyzing a user's search history, location, and other data, AI can tailor the search results to the user's specific interests and needs. This not only improves the user experience but also increases the likelihood of the user finding what they are looking for.\n\nFurthermore, AI is used in image and video search. With the help of computer vision and deep learning, search engines can analyze and understand the content of images and videos, making it possible to search for them using text queries.\n\nHowever, the use of AI in search engines also raises some concerns. Privacy is a major issue, as AI requires access to large amounts of user data to function effectively. There are also concerns about bias in AI algorithms, which could lead to unfair or inaccurate search results.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future of AI in search engines looks promising. With ongoing advancements in AI technology, we can expect search engines to become even more intelligent, efficient, and user-friendly. They will not only help us find the information we need but also anticipate our needs and provide us with information we didn't even know we were looking for.\n\nIn conclusion, AI has transformed the way we use search engines, making them more powerful, accurate, and personalized. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative applications in the field of search, further enhancing our online information-seeking experience.", "input_token_count": 829, "output_token_count": 552, "latency": 6.073333740234375}

Translating Python code to Java is not a straightforward task and may require significant changes due to differences in syntax, libraries, and language features.\n\nHowever, I can help you understand the Python function and guide you on how to implement a similar functionality in Java. Here's a brief explanation of the Python function:\n\nThe Python function `cleanup_logs` searches for and deletes log files within a specified directory that are older than a specified number of days. It takes a dictionary as an argument, which includes the directory path, file extension, age limit, whether to search recursively, and whether to simulate the deletion.\n\nIn Java, you can achieve a similar functionality using the `Files` class from the `java.nio.file` package. You would need to create a method that takes similar parameters, iterate through the files in the directory (and subdirectories if necessary), check the file's last modified time, and delete the file if it meets the criteria.\n\nHere's a very basic example of how you might start implementing this in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.nio.file.*;\nimport java.time.Duration;\nimport java.time.Instant;\nimport java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;\n\npublic class LogCleaner {\n    public void cleanupLogs(String path, String fileExtension, int ageLimit, boolean isRecursive, boolean isSimulation) {\n        try {\n            Files.walk(Paths.get(path))\n                    .filter(p -> p.toString().endsWith(\".\" + fileExtension))\n                    .filter(p -> isRecursive || !Files.isDirectory(p))\n                    .filter(p -> Duration.between(Files.getLastModifiedTime(p), Instant.now()).toDays() > ageLimit)\n                    .forEach(p -> {\n                        if (!isSimulation) {\n                            try {\n                                Files.delete(p);\n                            } catch (IOException e) {\n                                System.err.println(\"Failed to delete file: \" + p);\n                            }\n                        } else {\n                            System.out.println(\"Simulation: Would delete file: \" + p);\n                        }\n                    });\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error accessing directory: \" + path);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```", "input_token_count": 303, "output_token_count": 557, "latency": 5.988765239715576}
