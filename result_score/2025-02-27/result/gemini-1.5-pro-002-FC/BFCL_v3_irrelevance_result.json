He reorganized Athenian citizens into demes and tribes, promoting wider participation in government and legal processes.\n* **The Assembly (Ecclesia):**  In the Athenian democracy, the Assembly, composed of all eligible citizens, held legislative power. They debated and voted on laws, decrees, and other important matters.\n* **The Council of 500 (Boule):**  This council prepared the agenda for the Assembly and oversaw the day-to-day administration of the state, including some judicial functions.\n* **Juries (Dikasteria):**  Large juries of citizens chosen by lot played a central role in the Athenian legal system. They heard cases and delivered verdicts, acting as both judge and jury.\n\nIt's important to note that laws and legal systems varied across different Greek city-states (poleis) throughout history.
