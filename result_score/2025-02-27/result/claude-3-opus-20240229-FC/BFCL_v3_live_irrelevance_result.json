Some key facts about Java:\n\n- It is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, allowing compiled Java code to run on any platform that supports Java without recompilation.\n\n- Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. \n\n- The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.\n\n- Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun's Java platform.\n\n- It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.\n\n- Java is used for developing applications for a wide range of environments, from consumer devices to heterogeneous enterprise systems.\n\nSo in summary, Java is a versatile and widely used object-oriented programming language known for its \"write once, run anywhere\" principle, allowing Java code to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine.

Some common applications include virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and personalized recommendations.\n\nThe goal of AI research is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner, solving problems and carrying out tasks that typically require human-like cognition.

The precursor to pizza was likely focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius.\n\n- Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy in the 18th or early 19th century. \n\n- According to legend, the pizza Margherita was invented in 1889 when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. The pizza was garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil to represent the colors of the Italian flag.\n\n- Pizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late 19th century, with the first pizzeria in the U.S. opening in 1905 in New York City.\n\nSo in summary, while flatbread dishes existed for centuries, the modern pizza as we know it today originated in Naples, Italy in the 1700s or early 1800s before spreading to other parts of the world.

Object-oriented: Java is designed around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. This promotes code reusability and modularity.\n\n3. Robust and secure: Java has strong typing, exception handling, and memory management features that help prevent common programming errors and enhance security.\n\n4. Extensive standard library: Java comes with a vast collection of pre-written software packages that provide useful functionality, such as data structures, networking, I/O, and GUI development tools.\n\n5. Wide range of applications: Java is used for developing desktop applications, web applications, mobile apps (Android), embedded systems, and more.\n\nJava's slogan is \"Write once, run anywhere,\" reflecting its cross-platform capabilities.

Some key facts about him:\n\n- He played as a midfielder for clubs including Kyoto Purple Sanga, PSV Eindhoven, and most notably Manchester United from 2005-2012. He was the first Asian player to play in a UEFA Champions League final when he did so for Manchester United in 2009.\n\n- For the South Korea national team, Park earned 100 caps (appearances) from 2000-2011 and played in three World Cups. He was a key member of the 2002 World Cup team that reached the semi-finals on home soil. \n\n- Known for his work rate, stamina and versatility, Park was a highly effective two-way midfielder capable of contributing both defensively and in attack. His industrious style made him a fan favorite.\n\n- After retiring as a player in 2014, Park served as a global ambassador for Manchester United and has been involved in various charity and youth football initiatives to grow the sport in Asia.\n\nSo in summary, Ji-Sung Park was a trailblazing and successful South Korean footballer who had a distinguished career in Europe, especially with Manchester United, while also achieving over 100 international caps for his country.

Water molecules absorb longer wavelengths of light (reds, oranges, yellows) more strongly than shorter wavelengths (blues, greens). So more of the blue light is reflected back out of the water.\n\n2. Light scattering also plays a role. Water molecules and small particles in the water scatter shorter wavelengths of light more strongly, contributing to the predominantly blue appearance. \n\n3. Dissolved organic matter and suspended sediments can shift the color towards green, yellow or brown by absorbing and scattering light differently than pure water.\n\n4. In coastal areas, algae and other microorganisms can sometimes cause the water to appear greenish or reddish if they are present in high concentrations.\n\n5. The color can also be affected by the depth of the water, the angle of the sun, and weather conditions. Shallow waters over light sand will look very different than deep ocean waters.\n\nSo in summary, the blue color of the sea is mainly due to the selective absorption of light by water molecules combined with light scattering effects.

This positions you between competitor 1 at $99 and competitor 2 at $149. It's not the lowest price, but still provides a competitive and attractive option for more price-sensitive customers who only need a single filing.\n\nFor the annual subscription, price it at $199 per year. This is below competitor 2's $249 annual price but above competitor 1's $149. It reflects the added value of unlimited filings and updates throughout the year compared to the one-time option. Pricing it a bit higher than the lowest competitor helps maintain perceived value.\n\nThis pricing strategy avoids significantly undercutting competitors which could make your product seem inferior in quality. But it still prices you competitively as a strong mid-tier option that delivers good value to customers. The one-time and annual prices are also far enough apart to motivate customers to really consider the annual plan.\n\nOf course, you should continue to monitor competitor moves and customer reactions and adjust pricing if needed.
