However, based on fossil records and genetic studies, it is believed that pandas evolved from a common ancestor with other bears around 20-30 million years ago. The earliest known panda fossils date back to around 8-9 million years ago, during the late Miocene epoch. These early pandas were likely smaller and more omnivorous than modern pandas, and were found in a variety of habitats, including forests and grasslands.\n\nOver time, pandas evolved to become more specialized to their current diet of bamboo, which is low in nutrients and high in fiber. This specialization likely occurred around 2-3 million years ago, during the Pliocene epoch. Modern pandas are found only in a few mountain ranges in central China, where they inhabit bamboo forests at high elevations.\n\nDespite their specialized diet, pandas are still closely related to other bears, and share many physical and genetic characteristics with them. In fact, pandas are often considered to be part of the same family (Ursidae) as other bears, and are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor with the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) around 10-15 million years ago.\n\nOverall, the evolutionary history of pandas is a fascinating and complex topic that continues to be studied by scientists today.

If possible, place your piano near a window with a UV-filtering treatment.\n3. **Maintain a consistent temperature**: Avoid placing your piano near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows. A consistent temperature between 68\u00b0F and 72\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C) is ideal.\n4. **Humidity control**: Keep the humidity level in your home between 40% and 50%. Extreme humidity changes can cause the wood to shrink or expand, affecting the piano's sound and action.\n5. **Tune regularly**: Have your piano tuned every 6-12 months by a professional technician. This will ensure the piano sounds its best and prevent damage to the strings and action.\n6. **Adjust the pedals**: Make sure the pedals are properly adjusted to ensure smooth, even playing.\n7. **Clean the keys**: Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the keys. Avoid using chemicals or liquids, as they can damage the key surfaces.\n8. **Check for pests**: Regularly inspect your piano for signs of pests, such as mice or insects, which can damage the instrument.\n9. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Avoid placing your piano in areas with extreme temperatures, such as basements or attics.\n10. **Consider professional maintenance**: If you're unsure about maintaining your piano or if it requires more extensive repairs, consider hiring a professional technician.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep your piano in good condition and ensure it continues to sound its best for years to come.\n\nWould you like to know more about piano maintenance or perhaps inquire about renting a piano in a specific city?", "input_token_count": 435, "output_token_count": 423, "latency": 13.05986475944519}

Certain cards have special actions:\n   - Reverse: Reverses the direction of play.\n   - Skip: Skips the next player's turn.\n   - Take Two: Forces the next player to draw two cards and skip their turn.\n   - Wild: Can be played on any color and allows the player to change the color of play to any color.\n   - Wild Draw Four: Combination of the Wild and Take Two cards.\n8. If a player has only one card left in their hand, they must say \"Uno\" to alert the other players. If they fail to do so and are caught, they must draw two cards as a penalty.\n9. The game continues until one player has played all their cards. That player is the winner.\n\nNote: These are the basic rules of Uno.

Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese. Here's a rough outline of what you might need:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 8-10 lasagna noodles\n* 1 pound ground beef\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 cups marinara sauce\n* 1 cup ricotta cheese\n* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1 egg, beaten\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Fresh basil leaves, chopped (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.\n3. In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until it's browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks.\n4. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.\n5. Stir in the marinara sauce and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for a few minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly.\n6. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.\n7. Spread a layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.\n8. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by half of the shredded mozzarella cheese.\n9. Repeat the layers, starting with the meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese.\n10. Top the final layer of mozzarella cheese with the grated Parmesan cheese.\n11. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.\n12. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n13. Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves, if desired.\n\nI hope that helps!
