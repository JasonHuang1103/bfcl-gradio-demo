While I couldn't find the exact distance between Rivermist and Stonebrook, you can estimate your vehicle's range by considering its fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) and the current fuel level in the tank.

This rating tells you how many miles your car can travel per gallon of fuel.\n\n2. **Current Fuel Level**: Determine the current amount of fuel in your tank. You can do this by checking the fuel gauge on your dashboard or by estimating based on your recent refueling habits.\n\n3. **Calculate Range**: Multiply your vehicle's fuel efficiency by the current fuel level to get an estimate of how many miles you can travel before needing to refuel.\n\nFor example, if your car has a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon and your tank is half full (assuming a 15-gallon tank), you can estimate that you have about 187.5 miles of range (25 miles/gallon * 7.5 gallons).\n\nIf you need more precise information or if there's another way to specify the locations, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist further."], [[{"fillFuelTank": {"fuelAmount": 50}}], "<thinking> It seems there was an error because the fuel tank was already full or close to full, and attempting to add more fuel resulted in an error.
