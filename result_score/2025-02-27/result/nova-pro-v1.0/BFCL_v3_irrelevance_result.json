This typically involves setting up a development server and configuring build tools.\n\n4. **Create Components**: Break down your website into reusable components (e.g., header, footer, product list, product detail). Each component should handle a specific part of the UI.\n\n5. **Implement Routing**: Use a routing library (e.g., React Router for React) to handle navigation between different pages of your website.\n\n6. **Integrate with Backend**: Connect your frontend to your backend API to fetch and display data. Use libraries like Axios or Fetch to make HTTP requests.\n\n7. **Add Interactivity**: Implement user interactions such as adding items to a cart, filtering products, and handling user authentication.\n\n8. **Test Your Application**: Use testing libraries (e.g., Jest for React) to write unit and integration tests for your components and features.\n\n9. **Deploy Your Website**: Choose a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) to deploy your frontend application. Ensure that your website is optimized for performance and security.\n\n10. **Monitor and Maintain**: Use monitoring tools to track the performance and usage of your website. Regularly update your frontend to fix bugs and add new features.\n\nIf you need specific help with any of these steps, feel free to ask!", "input_token_count": 547, "output_token_count": 478, "latency": 7.713428974151611}

If the drawn card can be played, you may play it.\n   - Special cards have specific effects:\n     - **Skip**: Skips the next player's turn.\n     - **Reverse**: Reverses the direction of play.\n     - **Draw Two**: The next player must draw two cards and skip their turn.\n     - **Wild**: You can play this card on any turn and choose any color to continue play.\n     - **Wild Draw Four**: You can play this card when you have no other card that matches the current color. The next player must draw four cards and skip their turn. You must have no cards matching the current color when you play this card.\n\n4. **Winning**:\n   - When a player has only one card left, they must call out \"Uno.\"\n   - The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the round.\n   - Points are typically scored based on the cards remaining in other players' hands.\n\n5. **Scoring**:\n   - Number cards are worth their face value.\n   - Skip, Reverse, and Draw Two cards are worth 20 points each.\n   - Wild and Wild Draw Four cards are worth 50 points each.\n   - The game continues until one player reaches a predetermined point total (usually 500 points).\n\nThis is a general overview of the rules of Uno.
