{"id": "irrelevance_35", "result": "The mating process of lions is a complex and fascinating behavior that involves several stages and unique characteristics. Here's an overview of their mating process:\n\n1. **Courtship and Mating Behavior**: Lion courtship is a prolonged and intricate process. Male lions, known as lions, engage in a behavior called \"pouncing\" or \"roaring\" to attract females, called lionesses. They may also perform a ritualistic dance, known as \"flagging,\" where they raise their tails high in the air to display their genitals. During this time, lionesses may also engage in similar behaviors to signal their receptivity.\n\n2. **Scattering and Gathering**: After the initial courtship, lionesses often engage in a behavior called \"scattering,\" where they disperse to different areas to give birth and raise their cubs in relative privacy. Male lions, on the other hand, may continue to mate with multiple females during this period. When the cubs are old enough, the lionesses and their cubs gather back together, forming a pride.\n\n3. **Pride Formation**: Lionesses typically form groups called prides, which can consist of related females and their offspring, along with one or a few resident males. These prides provide a social structure and protection for the lionesses and their cubs. The resident male(s) within the pride are usually the fathers of the cubs and have the primary role of protecting the pride from rival males.\n\n4. **Male Competition and Takeover**: Male lions often compete with each other to gain access to females within a pride. This competition can be intense and may involve battles between rival males. If a new male takes over a pride, he may kill the cubs of the previous male(s) to ensure that the females in the pride are receptive to his mating. This behavior is known as \"infanticide.\"\n\n5. **Mating and Cub Raising**: Once a male gains access to the pride, he will mate with the females. Lionesses are receptive for a short period, usually during the early stages of their estrus cycle. After mating, the male may continue to protect and provide for the pride until the cubs are old enough to face the dangers of the outside world.\n\n6. **Dispersal and Solitary Life**: Male lions typically leave their birth pride when they reach adolescence and may either form a new pride or live as solitary individuals. They continue to roam and search for females to mate with, contributing to the genetic diversity of the population.\n\nThe mating process of lions is influenced by various factors, including social dynamics, territoriality, and the availability of resources.

Planting or maintaining vegetation, such as grasses, shrubs, and trees, provides essential nutrition and cover.\n   - Create or maintain open areas with fresh grass and browse, especially during the spring and summer when deer require more energy.\n   - Manage forest density to provide a mix of open spaces and dense vegetation, as deer often prefer areas with a combination of both.\n\n2. **Reducing Predation**:\n   - Control the population of natural predators like wolves, coyotes, and foxes, as predation can significantly impact deer numbers. This may involve implementing hunting regulations or using non-lethal methods to reduce predator-deer interactions.\n   - Protect young fawns by creating safe zones or using fencing to keep them away from high-risk areas.\n\n3. **Disease Management**:\n   - Monitor and control the spread of diseases that affect deer, such as chronic wasting disease or white-tailed deer diseases. Regular health checks and veterinary care can help identify and treat sick individuals.\n   - Maintain a healthy and diverse ecosystem to support the overall health of deer populations.\n\n4. **Human-Wildlife Conflict Mitigation**:\n   - Address human-wildlife conflicts, such as deer damaging crops or entering urban areas, as these can lead to negative perceptions and potential hunting pressure. Implement strategies like fencing, noise deterrents, or crop protection measures.\n\n5. **Research and Monitoring**:\n   - Conduct research to study deer behavior, population dynamics, and the impact of various management practices. This data can inform effective conservation strategies.\n   - Monitor deer populations regularly to assess their health, numbers, and distribution. This information is crucial for making informed management decisions.\n\n6. **Regulations and Conservation Efforts**:\n   - Implement and enforce hunting regulations to ensure sustainable harvesting and prevent over-exploitation.\n   - Collaborate with local communities, landowners, and conservation organizations to develop and support deer conservation initiatives.\n   - Consider reintroduction programs if deer populations have declined significantly due to historical factors.\n\n7. **Habitat Connectivity**:\n   - Promote habitat connectivity by creating wildlife corridors that link different forest areas. This allows deer to move freely, access resources, and maintain genetic diversity.\n\n8. **Public Education and Awareness**:\n   - Educate the public about the importance of deer conservation, the ecological role of deer, and the impact of human activities on their populations. This can foster a sense of stewardship and encourage responsible behavior.\n\nIt's important to note that increasing deer populations should be done in a sustainable manner, considering the overall ecosystem and the needs of other species within the forest.

{"id": "irrelevance_42", "result": "The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to the bamboo forests of China. It is one of the most iconic and well-known species in the world, and its unique diet and habitat have made it a symbol of conservation efforts.\n\nThe evolutionary history of pandas can be traced back to the family Ursidae, which includes all bears. The earliest known panda fossils date back to the late Miocene epoch, around 7.2 million years ago. These fossils were discovered in China and belong to a species called Ailurarctos, which is considered to be the ancestor of modern pandas.\n\nOver time, pandas evolved to become more specialized in their diet and habitat. They developed a strong preference for bamboo, which became their primary food source. This dietary specialization led to the development of several adaptations, such as a robust jaw and powerful teeth for crushing bamboo stems. The panda's body shape also became more rounded, with shorter limbs and a larger head, which helped them move efficiently through the dense bamboo forests.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene epoch, around 2.6 million years ago, pandas experienced a period of diversification. They evolved into several distinct species, including the giant panda's ancestor, Ailuropoda, which emerged in East Asia. This genus gave rise to two main branches: the ancient pandas (Ailuropoda baconi) and the modern giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca).\n\nThe ancient pandas, such as Ailuropoda baconi, were widespread across Asia during the Pleistocene. They had a more generalized diet and were not as specialized in bamboo consumption as their modern descendants. These ancient pandas went extinct around 200,000 years ago, possibly due to climate change and competition with other bear species.\n\nThe modern giant pandas evolved in isolation in the mountainous regions of China, developing their distinctive black and white coloration and becoming highly specialized bamboo feeders. They are the result of a long process of adaptation and natural selection, which allowed them to thrive in their specific environment.\n\nToday, the giant panda is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by human activities. Conservation efforts have been successful in increasing their population, and they are now a symbol of wildlife conservation worldwide.\n\nIn summary, the evolutionary history of pandas showcases the process of adaptation and specialization that occurred over millions of years, shaping them into the iconic and beloved species they are today.", "input_token_count": 109.0, "output_token_count": 496.0, "latency": 3.832462787628174}
{"id": "irrelevance_43", "result": "Applying an Evolutionary Algorithm in game Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a powerful approach to creating intelligent and adaptive agents that can learn and improve over time. Here's a breakdown of how you can utilize this algorithm in the context of game AI:\n\n1. **Define the Problem and Objective:**\n   - Clearly define the game scenario and the specific problem you want to solve. For example, in a game like chess or Go, the objective could be to develop a strategy to win the game. In a video game, it might be to optimize character abilities or pathfinding.\n\n2. **Represent the Game State and Actions:**\n   - Convert the game into a format that can be understood by the evolutionary algorithm. This involves representing the game state, possible actions, and the rules of the game. Each game element should be encoded in a way that allows for genetic operations (mutation, crossover) to be applied.\n\n3. **Initialize the Population:**\n   - Create an initial population of potential solutions or agents. Each individual in the population represents a unique set of characteristics or strategies. For instance, in a game, this could be different player profiles with varying attributes.\n\n4. **Define Fitness Function:**\n   - The fitness function evaluates the performance of each individual in the population. It should align with the game's objective. For example, in a game, fitness could be the number of wins, the score achieved, or the efficiency of resource management. The fitness function guides the evolutionary process by favoring individuals with better performance.\n\n5. **Evolutionary Operations:**\n   - Apply evolutionary algorithms like Genetic Algorithms or Evolutionary Strategies:\n   - **Mutation:** Introduce random variations in the population to explore new strategies. This helps in escaping local optima and improving exploration.\n   - **Crossover:** Combine genetic material from two parents to create offspring, mimicking natural selection. This operation helps in combining successful traits from different individuals.\n   - **Selection:** Choose the fittest individuals to reproduce and pass on their genetic information to the next generation. This step ensures that the population evolves towards better solutions.\n\n6. **Training and Iteration:**\n   - Run the evolutionary process for multiple generations, allowing the population to evolve and adapt.\n   - Evaluate the performance of the population after each generation using the fitness function.\n   - Adjust parameters like population size, mutation rate, and selection methods to optimize the algorithm's performance.\n\n7. **Gameplay and Adaptation:**\n   - Implement the evolved agents or strategies into the game environment.\n   - Let the agents interact with the game, making decisions based on their learned behaviors.\n   - Continuously monitor and refine the evolutionary process to improve the AI's performance over time.\n\n8. **Advanced Techniques:**\n   - Consider using techniques like tournament selection, genetic operators (such as gene shuffling or gene insertion), and adaptive mutation rates to enhance the algorithm's effectiveness.\n   - For more complex games, you might need to incorporate additional elements like memory mechanisms to remember past experiences and improve learning.\n\nBy applying evolutionary algorithms, game AI can learn and adapt to new challenges, making the game more engaging and dynamic. This approach has been successfully used in various games, from simple board games to complex video games, allowing AI opponents to become more intelligent and competitive.", "input_token_count": 111.0, "output_token_count": 658.0, "latency": 5.044376850128174}

{"id": "irrelevance_106", "result": "The best type of fertilizer for growing tomatoes depends on the specific needs of your plants and the type of soil you have. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n**1. Organic Fertilizers:**\n\n* **Composted Manure:** Rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), which are essential for tomato growth. Look for well-rotted manure to avoid burning the plants. Apply it as a side dressing around the plants or mix it into the soil before planting.\n* **Fish Emulsion:** Another excellent source of nitrogen and trace minerals. It has a lighter application rate compared to manure, so be cautious not to over-fertilize.\n* **Bone Meal:** High in phosphorus, which promotes strong root development and fruit set. Apply it when planting or as a side dressing early in the growing season.\n* **Blood Meal:** A concentrated source of nitrogen, ideal for boosting leaf growth and overall plant health. Use it sparingly, as too much can lead to burnt leaves.\n\n**2. Synthetic Fertilizers:**\n\n* **10-10-10 or Similar NPK Ratios:** A balanced synthetic fertilizer can provide a steady supply of nutrients throughout the growing season. Follow the package instructions carefully to avoid over-fertilization.\n* **Slow-Release Pellets:** These provide a controlled release of nutrients over an extended period, reducing the risk of over-fertilization.\n\n**Application Tips:**\n\n* **Timing:** Apply fertilizer at the beginning of the growing season, when plants are actively growing, and again halfway through the season.\n* **Amount:** Follow the recommended application rates on the fertilizer package. Avoid over-fertilizing, as it can lead to burnt leaves and other problems.\n* **Soil Testing:** Consider getting your soil tested to determine its nutrient levels and pH. This will help you choose the most appropriate fertilizer and adjust application rates accordingly.\n* **Side Dressing:** Apply fertilizer as a side dressing around the base of the plants, avoiding direct contact with the stems to prevent burns.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Tomatoes are heavy feeders and benefit from regular feeding throughout the growing season.\n* Always water the plants thoroughly after applying fertilizer to help the nutrients reach the roots.\n* Monitor your plants for signs of nutrient deficiencies or excesses and adjust your fertilization strategy accordingly.", "input_token_count": 78.0, "output_token_count": 487.0, "latency": 3.7965826988220215}

{"id": "irrelevance_126", "result": "The relationship between economic status and happiness levels is complex and multifaceted. While it is commonly believed that higher economic status leads to increased happiness, research suggests that this relationship is not as straightforward as often assumed.\n\nOn one hand, economic status can have a positive impact on happiness. Individuals with higher income, wealth, and access to resources may have more opportunities to meet their basic needs, achieve personal goals, and engage in activities that bring them joy. They may also have a greater sense of security and stability, which can contribute to overall well-being and life satisfaction. For example, a study by the World Happiness Report (2020) found that people in higher-income countries tend to report higher levels of happiness compared to those in lower-income countries.\n\nHowever, the relationship is not solely determined by economic status. Research has shown that once basic needs are met, the correlation between income and happiness becomes weaker. This is often referred to as the \"Easterlin Paradox,\" named after economist Richard Easterlin. Easterlin's work suggested that while higher income can lead to a short-term increase in happiness, the effect diminishes over time, and happiness levels tend to plateau at a certain income threshold.\n\nAdditionally, other factors play a significant role in happiness. Social connections, personal relationships, health, and a sense of purpose or meaning in life are all strongly associated with higher levels of happiness. These factors can often outweigh the impact of economic status, especially in the long term. For instance, a study by the University of Michigan (2010) found that social relationships and a sense of community were more strongly linked to happiness than income or wealth.\n\nFurthermore, the cultural and societal context also influences the relationship between economic status and happiness. In some cultures, happiness is more closely tied to community and social connections rather than individual wealth. Additionally, relative economic status, such as how one's income compares to others in society, can have a more significant impact on happiness than absolute economic status.\n\nIn summary, while economic status can contribute to happiness, it is not the sole determinant. The interplay of various factors, including social connections, personal relationships, health, and cultural context, also plays a crucial role in shaping happiness levels. Understanding this complex relationship can help in developing policies and interventions that promote overall well-being and happiness across different economic groups.", "input_token_count": 119.0, "output_token_count": 480.0, "latency": 3.772792100906372}

{"id": "irrelevance_140", "result": "The discovery of electricity is a complex and multifaceted process that involved the contributions of many scientists and inventors over centuries. It's challenging to attribute the discovery to a single individual.\n\nThe ancient Greeks were among the first to study electricity, with the philosopher Thales of Miletus observing the properties of amber and its ability to attract lightweight objects in around 600 BCE. This phenomenon, known as the amber effect, was one of the earliest recorded instances of the study of electricity.\n\nHowever, significant advancements in understanding electricity came in the 18th and 19th centuries. Here are a few key figures and their contributions:\n\n- **William Gilbert (1544-1603):** An English physician and natural philosopher, Gilbert is often referred to as the \"Father of Electricity.\" In his seminal work, *De Magnete* (1600), he extensively studied the magnetic properties of the Earth and proposed that the Earth itself was a magnet. Gilbert also investigated the amber effect and coined the term \"electricity\" from the Greek word for amber, \"elektron.\"\n\n- **Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790):** Franklin, an American scientist and statesman, made significant contributions to the understanding of electricity. In 1752, he conducted his famous kite experiment, demonstrating the connection between lightning and electricity. Franklin also introduced the concept of positive and negative charges and proposed the idea of a single fluid theory of electricity, suggesting that electricity was a form of fluid that could flow from one object to another.\n\n- **Michael Faraday (1791-1867):** Faraday, an English scientist, made groundbreaking discoveries in electromagnetism. He invented the first electric dynamo, which converted mechanical energy into electrical energy. Faraday also discovered electromagnetic induction, demonstrating that a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current in a nearby conductor. His work laid the foundation for the development of electric generators and transformers.\n\n- **James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879):** Maxwell, a Scottish physicist, unified the theories of electricity and magnetism with his set of equations now known as Maxwell's equations. These equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, which include visible light, radio waves, and X-rays. Maxwell's work showed that electricity and magnetism were two aspects of the same fundamental force.\n\nThese scientists, among many others, contributed to our understanding of electricity, leading to its practical application in various technologies we use today.", "input_token_count": 109.0, "output_token_count": 518.0, "latency": 4.010282516479492}

{"id": "irrelevance_171", "result": "In Ancient Greece, the establishment of laws and order was a complex and varied process, as different city-states and regions had their own unique political systems and forms of governance. Here are a few key aspects:\n\n- **City-State Governments**: Ancient Greece was composed of numerous city-states, each with its own form of government. Athens, for example, was known for its democracy, where citizens participated directly in decision-making. In contrast, Sparta had a more oligarchical system, with a small group of elders holding significant power.\n\n- **Lawgivers**: Certain individuals are often referred to as \"lawgivers\" due to their role in establishing legal codes. One of the most famous examples is Draco, an Athenian lawmaker who is said to have codified the laws of Athens in the 6th century BCE. His laws were known for their severity and are often associated with a strict and punitive legal system.\n\n- **Assembly and Courts**: Assemblies played a crucial role in the legislative process. Citizens would gather to debate and vote on matters of law and policy. Courts, often presided over by judges or magistrates, were responsible for interpreting and applying the laws.\n\n- **Ostracism**: A unique feature of the Athenian democracy was the practice of ostracism, where citizens could vote to exile influential individuals for a period of ten years if they were deemed a threat to the state. This was a form of collective decision-making and a way to manage political dissent.\n\n- **City-State Independence**: Each city-state had its own legal system, and these laws often reflected the specific needs and values of the local community. For instance, the laws of Athens were influenced by its democratic ideals, while Spartan laws emphasized military discipline and the education of youth.\n\n- **Influence of Philosophy**: Greek philosophy also played a role in shaping legal thought. Thinkers like Plato and Aristotle contributed to discussions on justice, ethics, and the ideal state, which could influence the development of legal principles.\n\nIt's important to note that the concept of \"laws and order\" in Ancient Greece was not identical to modern legal systems, and the political and social structures varied widely across the region.", "input_token_count": 70.0, "output_token_count": 451.0, "latency": 3.580252170562744}

These chords are often used to create a sense of resolution and movement in a song.\n\nHere's a breakdown of these chords and their functions:\n\n1. **I (Tonic) Chord**: This chord is the foundation of the song and often represents the key of the composition. It provides a sense of home and stability. For example, in the key of C major, the I chord is C major itself (C, E, G).\n\n2. **IV (Subdominant) Chord**: The IV chord is often used to create a feeling of movement and anticipation. It is typically a minor chord in a major key or a major chord in a minor key. In the key of C major, the IV chord is F major (F, A, C).\n\n3. **V (Dominant) Chord**: The V chord is used to create tension and a sense of resolution when it leads back to the I chord. It is often a minor chord in a major key or a major chord in a minor key. In the key of C major, the V chord is G minor (G, B, D).\n\nPop songs often use these chords in various progressions to create a catchy and memorable melody. The I-IV-V progression is a classic and widely used structure in pop music, providing a simple yet effective framework for songwriting.\n\nAdditionally, some other common chords in pop music include:\n\n- **ii (Supertonic) Chord**: This chord is often used to create a sense of movement and tension, leading to the I or V chords. In the key of C major, the ii chord is D minor (D, F, A).\n\n- **iii (Mediant) Chord**: The iii chord is a minor chord that often resolves to the I or IV chords. In C major, it is E minor (E, G, B).\n\n- **vi (Submediant) Chord**: The vi chord is a minor chord that creates a sense of nostalgia and often leads to the I or V chords. In C major, it is A minor (A, C, E).\n\n- **VII (Leading Tone) Chord**: The VII chord is a dominant seventh chord that creates tension and often resolves to the I chord. In C major, it is B diminished (B, D, F, A).\n\nThese chords and their progressions form the basis of many pop songs, providing a familiar and accessible sound that resonates with listeners.", "input_token_count": 75.0, "output_token_count": 542.0, "latency": 4.150644063949585}

The Wild card can be used to change the colour of the discard pile, and the Draw Two card forces the next player to draw two cards.\n\n4. **Special Action Cards**:\n   - **Skip**: When played, the next player in turn order must skip their turn.\n   - **Reverse**: When played, the direction of play is reversed.\n   - **Wild**: Can be used to change the colour of the discard pile.\n   - **Draw Two**: Forces the next player to draw two cards.\n\n5. **Uno**: When you have only one card left in your hand, you must shout \"Uno!\" to alert other players. Failing to do so may result in a penalty.\n\n6. **Winning**: The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game. If there are remaining cards in other players' hands, the player with the fewest cards wins.

{"id": "irrelevance_200", "result": "In Blackjack, the Ace is a unique card that can be valued as either 1 or 11, depending on the situation. This flexibility is a key feature of the game and can significantly impact the player's strategy. Here are the rules for Aces in Blackjack:\n\n- **Natural Blackjack:** If a player is dealt an Ace and a card with a value of 10 (such as a 10, Jack, Queen, or King) in the initial two-card hand, this is called a \"natural Blackjack\" or \"Blackjack.\" It is a winning hand and pays 3:2 odds, unless the player has a Blackjack, in which case it pays 1:1.\n\n- **Aces as 1 or 11:** When an Ace is drawn, the player can choose to count it as either 1 or 11. This decision is made at the time of drawing the card and cannot be changed later. Counting it as 11 is generally more advantageous for the player, as it increases the total value of the hand without going over 21 (the point at which the hand busts).\n\n- **Soft Hands:** An Ace counted as 11 is called a \"soft\" hand because it does not bust when the total value of the hand exceeds 21. For example, if a player has an Ace (11) and a 10-value card (10), the total is 21, which is a strong hand without busting.\n\n- **Hard Hands:** An Ace counted as 1 is called a \"hard\" hand. In this case, the hand's value is the sum of the Ace and the other cards. For instance, an Ace (1) and a 9 would total 10.\n\n- **Splitting Aces:** In many Blackjack variations, players have the option to split Aces. This means that if a player is dealt two Aces, they can treat them as separate hands and place an additional bet on each Ace. Each Ace then counts as 11, and the player is allowed to draw cards for each hand independently.\n\n- **Double Down with Aces:** Players can also choose to double their bet when they are dealt an Ace, but they must count it as 11. This strategy is often used when the player has a strong hand and wants to maximize their potential winnings.\n\n- **Insurance:** When the dealer's upcard is an Ace, players can take \"insurance.\" This side bet pays 2:1 if the dealer has Blackjack, which is a favorable outcome for the player. However, insurance is generally not recommended as it has a high house edge.\n\nThe rules for Aces in Blackjack provide players with strategic options and can significantly influence the outcome of the game, making it an exciting and dynamic card game.", "input_token_count": 78.0, "output_token_count": 589.0, "latency": 4.505730628967285}

{"id": "irrelevance_212", "result": "Boiling an egg is a simple process, but the best method can vary depending on your desired outcome. Here\u2019s a guide to help you boil an egg perfectly:\n\n### 1. **Choose the Right Egg**\n- **Freshness**: Use eggs that are at least one week old. Older eggs have larger air cells, which can cause the egg to crack during cooking.\n- **Size**: The size of the egg will determine how long it takes to cook. Larger eggs will take longer to cook.\n\n### 2. **Prepare the Egg**\n- **Room Temperature**: Let the egg sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking. This helps the egg cook more evenly.\n- **Crack the Shell**: Gently crack the egg on a flat surface to avoid breaking the yolk.\n\n### 3. **Boiling Time**\n- **Soft-Boiled Egg**: For a soft-boiled egg, where the yolk is still runny and the white is set but not dry, follow these times:\n  - **Small Egg (50-60g)**: 4-5 minutes\n  - **Medium Egg (60-70g)**: 6-7 minutes\n  - **Large Egg (70-80g)**: 8-10 minutes\n- **Hard-Boiled Egg**: For a hard-boiled egg, where both the yolk and white are completely set, follow these times:\n  - **Small Egg (50-60g)**: 10-12 minutes\n  - **Medium Egg (60-70g)**: 12-14 minutes\n  - **Large Egg (70-80g)**: 14-16 minutes\n\n### 4. **Boiling Method**\n- **Stovetop**: Place the eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer.\n- **Electric Egg Cooker**: Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the desired cooking time.\n\n### 5. **Cooling**\n- **Ice Bath (Optional)**: After cooking, immediately transfer the eggs to an ice bath (a bowl of cold water with ice) to stop the cooking process and make them easier to peel.\n\n### 6. **Peeling**\n- **Soft-Boiled**: For soft-boiled eggs, tap the egg on a hard surface and roll it under cold running water to loosen the shell. Peel off the shell under running water.\n- **Hard-Boiled**: For hard-boiled eggs, tap the egg on a hard surface and roll it under cold running water to loosen the shell. Peel off the shell under running water.\n\n### 7. **Serving**\n- **Soft-Boiled**: Serve the egg whole or slice it.\n- **Hard-Boiled**: Slice the egg in half and serve.\n\n### Tips:\n- **Salt the Water**: Adding a pinch of salt to the water can help the eggs peel more easily.\n- **Avoid Overcooking**: Overcooking can make the egg tough and the yolk grainy.\n- **Store Properly**: Store cooked eggs in the refrigerator and use them within 1-2 days.\n\nBy following these steps, you can boil an egg to your desired doneness every time!", "input_token_count": 99.0, "output_token_count": 720.0, "latency": 5.44345235824585}
