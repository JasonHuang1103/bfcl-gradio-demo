The distance between San Francisco and Redding is approximately 240 miles (386 kilometers) by road.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step approach to determine the distance and estimate fuel consumption and travel time:\n\n1. **Distance**: \n   - From San Francisco to Redding: ~240 miles (386 km)\n\n2. **Fuel Consumption**:\n   - Assume you are driving a mid-sized sedan with an average fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon (mpg).\n   - To find the fuel needed: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Fuel needed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Fuel efficiency}} = \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ mpg}} = 9.6 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Travel Time**:\n   - Assuming an average driving speed of 60 miles per hour (mph):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Travel time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ mph}} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nIf Rivermist is significantly different from Redding, you would need to adjust the distance accordingly.
