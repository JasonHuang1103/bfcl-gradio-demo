Number Cards (0-9) in four colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)\n2. Action Cards:\n   - Skip: Next player loses their turn\n   - Reverse: Changes direction of play\n   - Draw Two: Next player draws 2 cards and loses their turn\n3. Wild Cards:\n   - Wild: Player can choose the next color\n   - Wild Draw Four: Next player draws 4 cards, loses their turn, and you choose the color\n\nGameplay:\n1. Players take turns playing one card that matches either:\n   - The color of the top card on the discard pile\n   - The number/symbol of the top card\n   - Or play a Wild card (can be played anytime)\n\n2. If a player can't play a card, they must draw one card from the draw pile\n   - If they can play the drawn card, they may do so\n   - If not, their turn ends\n\n3. When playing their second-to-last card, players must say \"UNO\"\n   - If they don't and are caught, they must draw 2 cards\n\nWinning:\n- The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the round\n- Points are typically scored based on the cards remaining in other players' hands\n\nNote: There are various house rules and variations that people often play with, but these are the standard basic rules of Uno.\n\nWhile I can't demonstrate actual gameplay, I could help shuffle an Uno deck if needed using the available tool.
