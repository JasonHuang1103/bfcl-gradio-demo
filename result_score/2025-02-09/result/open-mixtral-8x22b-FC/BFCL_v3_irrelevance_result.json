In addition, the deck contains four each of \"Wild\" and \"Wild Draw Four\" cards.\n\nThe objective of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved by being the first to play all of your cards. Points are scored by having other players accumulate cards in their hands.\n\nThe game begins with each player being dealt seven cards. The remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned over to begin a discard pile.\n\nOn a player's turn, they must match the top card of the discard pile by either color, number, or symbol. If a player cannot make a match, they must draw a card from the draw pile. If they can play what is drawn, they are free to do so, but they may not play a card on the same turn they draw.\n\nSpecial cards in Uno include:\n\n- Skip: The next player is \"skipped\".\n- Reverse: Reverses the direction of play.\n- Draw Two: The next player must draw two cards and lose their turn.\n- Wild: Can be played on any card. The player has to choose the color that continues play.\n- Wild Draw Four: The player chooses the color that continues play, and the next player must draw four cards and lose their turn.\n\nWhen a player has only one card left, they must yell \"Uno!\" to indicate this. If they are caught not saying \"Uno\" and another player catches them before the next player begins their turn, they must draw two cards.\n\nThe game continues until a player has no cards left.

Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the goal (Point B).\n\nThe A* algorithm is widely used in game development and other fields because it's efficient and effective at finding the shortest path.

{"id": "irrelevance_238", "result": "The hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In mathematical notation, this is expressed as:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nGiven that the lengths of the other two sides are 5 and 6, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\nc\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + 6\u00b2\nc\u00b2 = 25 + 36\nc\u00b2 = 61\n\nTo find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nc = \u221a61\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is approximately 7.81 units.", "input_token_count": 341, "output_token_count": 193, "latency": 2.52567195892334}
