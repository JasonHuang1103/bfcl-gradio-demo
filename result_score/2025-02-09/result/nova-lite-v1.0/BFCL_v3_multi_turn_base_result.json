However, I can provide a general estimate based on average fuel efficiency. If we assume an average fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon, and considering the fuel level is currently 42.0 gallons, the vehicle can travel approximately 1050 miles (42.0 gallons * 25 miles/gallon). If the distance to Rivermist is less than this, the current fuel should suffice. If it's more, you would need to refuel. However, without the exact distance, I can't provide the exact amount of fuel needed.
