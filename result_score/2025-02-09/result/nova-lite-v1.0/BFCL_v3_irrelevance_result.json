They are often characterized by their dramatic, soaring height and the way they draw the eye upward, creating a sense of spaciousness and grandeur. Here are some tips for designing a cathedral ceiling:\n\n1. **Height**: The key feature of a cathedral ceiling is its height. The higher the ceiling, the more dramatic the effect. However, keep in mind that higher ceilings can also make a room feel colder and more difficult to heat.\n\n2. **Materials**: The materials you choose for your cathedral ceiling can greatly affect its appearance and feel. Wood can create a warm, rustic look, while metal or glass can give a modern, industrial feel.\n\n3. **Lighting**: Because of their height, cathedral ceilings can be difficult to light. Consider using a combination of overhead lighting and accent lighting to ensure the entire space is well-lit.\n\n4. **Design Elements**: You can add interest to a cathedral ceiling with design elements such as beams, molding, or decorative panels. These can add texture and visual interest to the space.\n\n5. **Furniture and Decor**: When designing a room with a cathedral ceiling, consider how the height will affect your furniture and decor choices. You may need to choose furniture that is proportionate to the height of the ceiling, and you may want to use taller plants or artwork to fill the space.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful cathedral ceiling design is balance. You want to create a sense of grandeur without making the space feel overwhelming or out of proportion.", "input_token_count": 492, "output_token_count": 386, "latency": 3.3556630611419678}

Regular tuning helps maintain the piano's sound quality and ensures that it stays in tune.\n\n3. **Humidity Control**: Pianos are sensitive to changes in humidity. Use a humidifier or dehumidifier to maintain a consistent level of humidity in the room where the piano is kept.\n\n4. **Avoid Extreme Temperatures**: Keep the piano away from direct sunlight, heaters, and air conditioning vents, as extreme temperatures can cause the wood to warp and the piano to go out of tune.\n\n5. **Cover the Piano**: When not in use, cover the piano with a dust cover to protect it from dust and debris.\n\n6. **Professional Maintenance**: Consider having a professional piano technician inspect and maintain your piano every few years to ensure it remains in good condition.", "input_token_count": 496, "output_token_count": 273, "latency": 2.722618818283081}

The formula is c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). However, the available tool is for calculating the distance between two points on Earth, not for calculating the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.
