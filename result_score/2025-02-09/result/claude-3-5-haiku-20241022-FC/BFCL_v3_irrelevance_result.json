Structural Considerations:\n- Cathedral ceilings are characterized by their steep, vaulted design that follows the roof pitch\n- Typically involves exposing the roof rafters and creating an open, airy feel\n- Requires careful structural engineering to support the roof and provide proper insulation\n\n2. Key Design Elements:\n- Pitch: Steep pitch (usually 8:12 or higher) creates the dramatic, soaring effect\n- Height: Aim for at least 12-16 feet at the highest point\n- Natural Light: Incorporate large windows or skylights to enhance the spacious feel\n- Exposed Beams: Consider leaving wooden rafters or adding decorative trusses visible\n\n3. Material Choices:\n- Wood: Wooden beams and tongue-and-groove ceiling can create warmth\n- Drywall: Smooth finish for a more modern look\n- Stone or brick: Can add texture and architectural interest\n- Paint colors: Light colors can make the space feel larger and brighter\n\n4. Insulation and Ventilation:\n- Use proper insulation techniques (often rigid foam board)\n- Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent moisture buildup\n- Consider adding ridge vents or soffit vents\n\n5. Lighting Considerations:\n- Pendant lights or chandeliers can emphasize the height\n- Recessed lighting can provide even illumination\n- Consider track lighting for flexibility\n\n6. Room Considerations:\n- Works best in living rooms, great rooms, or main living spaces\n- Complements open floor plans\n- Can make smaller rooms feel more spacious\n\n7. Professional Advice:\n- Consult with an architect or structural engineer\n- Ensure local building codes are met\n- Get professional help with complex roof structures\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific design advice for your cathedral ceiling?"], "input_token_count": 412, "output_token_count": 433, "latency": 9.464017152786255}

It is not suitable for calculating the hypotenuse of a triangle.\n\nHowever, I can help you calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. \n\nGiven:\n- Side a = 5\n- Side b = 6\n\nTo calculate the hypotenuse (side c), we use the formula: c = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nCalculation:\nc = \u221a(5\u00b2 + 6\u00b2)\nc = \u221a(25 + 36)\nc = \u221a61\nc \u2248 7.81\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is approximately 7.81 units.\n\nIf you need to calculate geographical distances between points, I can help you use the `map_coordinates_distance_calculate` tool.
