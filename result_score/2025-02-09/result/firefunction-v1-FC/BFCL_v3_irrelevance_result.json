If the piano is used frequently, it may need to be tuned more often.\n\n3. Clean the piano regularly: Use a soft cloth to dust the keys and exterior of the piano. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials.\n\n4. Keep the piano away from direct sunlight: Direct sunlight can cause the finish to fade and the wood to warp.\n\n5. Have the piano serviced regularly: A professional technician can check for any issues and make necessary repairs.\n\n6. Avoid eating or drinking near the piano: Spills can damage the keys and finish.\n\n7. Keep the piano covered when not in use: This will protect the piano from dust and other debris.\n\n8. Use a humidifier or dehumidifier if necessary: If the room is too dry or too humid, it can affect the tuning and overall health of the piano.\n\n9. Avoid moving the piano yourself: Pianos are heavy and can be easily damaged if not moved properly. It's best to hire a professional to move the piano.\n\n10.
