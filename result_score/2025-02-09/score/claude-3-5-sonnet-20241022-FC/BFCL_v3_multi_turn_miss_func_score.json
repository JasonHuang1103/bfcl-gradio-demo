Let me check the updated list of functions.\n\nAfter reviewing the available functions, I can still see that the `get_zipcode_based_on_city` function remains available, and my previous attempt returned \"83214\" as the zipcode for Rivermist. This function is still working as before. \n\nIf you're suggesting there might be different or better functions to use for this purpose, could you please let me know what specific functionality you're interested in? Also, if you have reason to believe the zipcode result might not be accurate, please let me know and we can try to verify this information through other means if such functions are now available.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Try the zipcode lookup again?\n2. Use a different function to get this information?\n3. Look up something else about Rivermist?\n\nPlease let me know what specific information you're looking for and I'll be happy to help using the most appropriate function from the updated set."]}, {"role": "handler_log", "content": "Error decoding the model response.
