Its primary function is to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy currency of the cell. Here's how ATP synthase accomplishes this:\n\n1. **Chemiosmosis**: ATP synthase is part of the electron transport chain (ETC) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As electrons move through the ETC, they create a proton gradient across the membrane, with a higher concentration of protons on the outside compared to the inside.\n\n2. **Proton Flow**: The protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix (the inner compartment of the mitochondria) through ATP synthase. This flow is driven by the proton gradient and is known as chemiosmosis.\n\n3. **ATP Synthesis**: The flow of protons through ATP synthase drives the synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is known as oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n4. **Rotary Motor**: ATP synthase acts as a rotary motor. As protons flow through the enzyme, it rotates, which in turn causes a conformational change in the enzyme that allows the attachment of ADP and Pi to form ATP.\n\n5. **Coupling of ATP Synthesis to Electron Transport**: The flow of protons through ATP synthase is tightly coupled to the synthesis of ATP. This means that the energy from the proton gradient is used to drive the synthesis of ATP, ensuring that the energy released during the electron transport chain is efficiently converted into a usable form.\n\nIn summary, the function of ATP synthase in mitochondria is to convert the chemical energy stored in the form of a proton gradient into the chemical energy of ATP, which is essential for various cellular processes that require energy.", "possible_answer": [{"cell_biology.function_lookup": {"molecule": ["ATP synthase"], "organelle": ["mitochondria"], "specific_function": [true]}}]}

It's particularly effective on gentle slopes and can also be used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.\n\n2. **Sedum (Sedum spp.)**: Sedum, also known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant that is excellent for erosion control. It has a shallow root system that helps to bind the soil together, and its drought-resistant nature makes it suitable for dry, sloped areas.\n\n3. **Bermuda Grass (Cynodon dactylon)**: Bermuda grass is a type of grass that is known for its ability to establish quickly and form a dense sod. It's often used for erosion control on hillsides and can help to prevent soil erosion due to its strong root system.\n\nPlease note that the suitability of these plants can vary depending on the specific conditions of the slope, such as soil type, climate, and the severity of the slope. It's always best to consult with a local extension service or a landscaping professional to determine the most appropriate plants for your specific situation.", "possible_answer": [{"get_plants_for_slope": {"slope_type": ["hill", "steep", "moderate"], "num_results": [3]}}]}

It was fought against France and resulted in a decisive victory for the German states led by Prussia, leading to the establishment of the German Empire in 1871.\n\n2. **World War I (1914-1918)**: Germany was a central power in the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy. The war began with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary and quickly escalated into a global conflict involving most of the world's nations. Germany's military strategy, known as the Schlieffen Plan, aimed to defeat France quickly and then turn east to defeat Russia. However, the plan failed, and the war ended in Germany's defeat in 1918, leading to the end of the German Empire and the rise of the Weimar Republic.\n\n3. **Weimar Republic and the Treaty of Versailles (1919)**: After World War I, Germany was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed heavy war reparations, territorial losses, and military restrictions. The treaty was deeply resented in Germany and contributed to political instability and the rise of the Nazi Party.\n\n4. **World War II (1939-1945)**: Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, invaded Poland in September 1939, which triggered the start of World War II. The war involved massive military campaigns across Europe and Asia, including the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Germany's military, initially successful, eventually faced a formidable Allied coalition and was defeated in 1945.\n\n5. **Invasion of Poland (1939)**: Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, was the direct cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe.\n\n6. **Battle of Britain (1940)**: In the summer of 1940, Germany attempted to gain air superiority over Britain by launching a massive air campaign known as the Battle of Britain. Despite initial successes, the Luftwaffe failed to achieve its objectives, and Britain held out.\n\n7. **Invasion of the Soviet Union (1941)**: On June 22, 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in what was known as Operation Barbarossa. The initial phase of the invasion was successful, but the Soviet Union eventually mounted a successful counteroffensive.\n\n8. **Battle of Stalingrad (1942-1943)**: One of the most significant battles of World War II, the Battle of Stalingrad resulted in a decisive Soviet victory over the German Sixth Army. It was a turning point in the Eastern Front.\n\n9. **D-Day (1944)**: On June 6, 1944, Allied forces landed in Normandy, France, in what was the largest amphibious invasion in history. This marked the beginning of the liberation of Western Europe from German occupation.\n\n10. **Berlin Blockade and Airlift (1948-1949)**: After World War II, the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin, cutting off all land routes to the city. The United States and its allies responded with the Berlin Airlift, flying supplies into the city to sustain the population.\n\n11. **German Surrender (1945)**: On May 7, 1945, Germany unconditionally surrendered to the Allies, effectively ending World War II in Europe. The formal surrender was signed on May 8, 1945, which is now celebrated as Victory in Europe Day (VE Day).\n\nThese events are just a snapshot of the complex and tumultuous period in German history from 1871 to 1945.", "possible_answer": [{"history.get_key_events": {"country": ["Germany", "DE"], "start_year": [1871], "end_year": [1945], "event_type": [["War"]]}}]}

This curvature is caused by mass and energy, and it affects the paths that objects take through space and time. The theory predicts several phenomena that were later confirmed by observation, such as the bending of light by gravity (gravitational lensing), the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, and the existence of black holes.\n\nEinstein's General Relativity is one of the pillars of modern physics, alongside quantum mechanics, and it has had profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos.", "possible_answer": [{"historical_contrib.get_contrib": {"scientist": ["Albert Einstein"], "date": ["1915-03-17", "03/17/1915", "Mar.17,1915"], "category": ["", "all"]}}]}

Note that the provided function is in Python 3 syntax.\",  \"parameters\": {    \"type\": \"object\",    \"properties\": {      \"location\": {        \"type\": \"string\",        \"description\": \"The city where you want to book the hotel.\"      },      \"room_type\": {        \"type\": \"string\",        \"description\": \"Type of the room required. Options: 'single', 'double', 'deluxe', etc.\"      },      \"duration\": {        \"type\": \"integer\",        \"description\": \"The number of nights you want to book the hotel for.\"      },      \"start_date\": {        \"type\": \"string\",        \"description\": \"The date when your stay begins.\"      },      \"preferences\": {        \"type\": \"array\",        \"items\": {          \"type\": \"string\",          \"enum\": [            \"pet_friendly\",            \"gym\",            \"swimming_pool\",            \"free_breakfast\",            \"parking\"          ]        },        \"description\": \"Optional preferences of stay at the hotel. Default to use all if not specified.\"      }    },    \"required\": [      \"location\",      \"room_type\",      \"duration\",      \"start_date\"    ]  },  \"required\": [    \"location\",    \"room_type\",    \"duration\",    \"start_date\"  ]}``` You can use this API to book a single room at a pet friendly hotel near Manhattan, New York for 3 nights starting from March 10th, 2023.", "possible_answer": [{"hotel_booking": {"location": ["Manhattan, New York", "Manhattan, NY", "NYC", "New York City"], "room_type": ["single"], "duration": [3], "start_date": ["2023-03-10", "03/10/2023", "Mar.10,2023", "March 10th, 2023", "March 10th,2023", "March10th, 2023", "March10th,2023"], "preferences": [["pet_friendly"]]}}]}
